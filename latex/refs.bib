	Abstract = {We pose the problem of 3D human tracking as one of inference in a graphical model. Unlike traditional kinematic tree representations, our model of the body is a collection of loosely-connected limbs. Conditional probabilities relating the 3D pose of connected limbs are learned from motion-captured training data. Similarly, we learn probabilistic models for the temporal evolution of each limb (forward and backward in time). Human pose and motion estimation is then solved with non-parametric belief propagation using a variation of particle filtering that can be applied over a general loopy graph. The loose-limbed model and decentralized graph structure facilitate the use of low-level visual cues. We adopt simple limb and head detectors to provide "bottom-up" information that is incorporated into the inference process at every time-step; these detectors permit automatic initialization and aid recovery from transient tracking failures. We illustrate the method by automatically tracking a walking person in video imagery using four calibrated cameras. Our experimental apparatus includes a marker-based motion capture system aligned with the coordinate frame of the calibrated cameras with which we quantitatively evaluate the accuracy of our 3D person tracker. },

	Abstract = {Brain circuit mapping requires digital reconstruction of neuronal morphologies in complicated networks. Despite recent advances in automatic algorithms, reconstruction of neuronal structures is still a bottleneck in circuit mapping due to a lack of appropriate software for both efficient reconstruction and user-friendly editing. Here we present a new software design based on the SWC format, a standardized neuromorphometric format that has been widely used for analyzing neuronal morphologies or sharing neuron reconstructions via online archives such as NeuroMorpho.org. We have also implemented the design in our open-source software called neuTube 1.0. As specified by the design, the software is equipped with parallel 2D and 3D visualization and intuitive neuron tracing/editing functions, allowing the user to efficiently reconstruct neurons from fluorescence image data and edit standard neuron structure files produced by any other reconstruction software. We show the advantages of neuTube 1.0 by comparing it to two other software tools, namely Neuromantic and Neurostudio. The software is available for free at http://www.neutracing.com, which also hosts complete software documentation and video tutorials. Significance Statement: Compared to other existing tools, the novel software we present has some unique features such as comprehensive editing functions and the combination of seed-based tracing and path searching algorithms, as well as their availability in parallel 2D and 3D visualization. These features allow the user to reconstruct neuronal morphology efficiently in a comfortable {\textquoteleft}What You See Is What You Get{\textquoteright} (WYSIWYG) way.},

@article{Bailer2017,
	Abstract = {Learning based approaches have not yet achieved their full potential in optical flow estimation, where their performance still trails heuristic approaches. In this paper, we present an optical flow pipeline that uses patch matching with CNN trained features at multiple scales. We present a novel way for calculating CNN based features for different scales, which performs better than existing methods. Furthermore, we introduce a new thresholded loss for Siamese networks and demonstrate that our loss performs clearly better than existing losses. It also allows to speed up training by a factor of 2 in our tests. Moreover, we discuss new ways of evaluating the robustness of trained features for the application of patch matching for optical flow. An interesting discovery in our paper is that low-pass filtering of feature maps can increase the robustness of features created by CNNs. We proved the competitive performance of our approach by submitting it to the KITTI 2012, KITTI 2015 and MPI-Sintel evaluation portals where we obtained state-of-the-art results on all three datasets.},

	Abstract = {We study the 3D neurite tracing problem in different imaging modalities. We consider that the examined images do not provide sufficient contrast between neurite and background, and the signal-to-noise ratio varies spatially. We first split the stack into box sub-volumes, and inside each box we evolve simultaneously a number of different open-curve snakes. The curves deform based on three criteria: local image statistics, local shape smoothness, and a term that enforces pairwise attraction between snakes, given their spatial proximity and shapes. We validate our method using larva Drosophila sensory neurons imaged with confocal laser scanning microscopy, as well as publicly available datasets.},

	Abstract = {We propose an approach to reconstructing tree structures that evolve over time in 2D images and 3D image stacks such as neuronal axons or plant branches. Instead of reconstructing structures in each image independently, we do so for all images simultaneously to take advantage of temporal-consistency constraints. We show that this problem can be formulated as a Quadratic Mixed Integer Program and solved efficiently. The outcome of our approach is a framework that provides substantial improvements in reconstructions over traditional single time-instance formulations. Furthermore, an added benefit of our approach is the ability to automatically detect places where significant changes have occurred over time, which is challenging when considering large amounts of data.},

We aim at increased robustness under spatially varying neurite-background contrast, and at the same time reducing the computational complexity compared to the state-of-the-art. While most existing active contour based methods perform tracing by evolving multiple snakes along the neurite centerline in a sequential manner, our approach implements a simultaneous evolution, reducing the complexity as we show theoretically in our algorithm analysis and experimentally. Our approach provides increased accuracy in ambiguous regions (e.g., low contrast, neurite bifurcations and crossovers, etc.), by exploiting interactions among spatially neighboring snakes. We illustrate the performance of our method and compare it with existing frameworks using sample volumes of wild-type sensory neurons in the larval Drosophila.},

Snakes are active contour models: they lock onto nearby edges, localizing them accurately. Scale-space continuation can be used to enlarge the capture region surrounding a feature. Snakes provide a unified account of a number of visual problems, including detection of edges, lines, and subjective contours; motion tracking; and stereo matching.
