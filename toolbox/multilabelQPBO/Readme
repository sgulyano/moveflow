# Matlab Wrapper for Fusion Moves (QPBO + alpha-expansion)
by Sarun Gulyanon 24.04.2017

---------------------
Description
---------------------
Fusion Moves is a method based on QPBO and alpha-expansion to optimize the multilabel graphical model like MRF and CRF. The energy function of graphical model can be non-submodular unlike graph cuts. QPBO is originally designed for binary graphical model, then alpha-expansion extends it to multi-label problem. I implemented only the alpha-expansion wrapper built on top of qpboMex (mex files of binary QPBO). This is implemented for educational purposes.

---------------------
Instruction
---------------------
* First download qpboMex (https://github.com/aosokin/qpboMex) and extract it (make sure it is included using addpath function). However you need MIT license to use this repository.
* To run, see example_fusion_moves.m for example.
* For more details of the function, type >> help fusion_moves
