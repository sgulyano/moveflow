@article{Grueber2002,
	Abstract = {Insect dendritic arborization (da) neurons provide an opportunity to examine how diverse dendrite morphologies and dendritic territories are established during development. We have examined the morphologies of Drosophila da neurons by using the MARCM (mosaic analysis with a repressible cell marker) system. We show that each of the 15 neurons per abdominal hemisegment spread dendrites to characteristic regions of the epidermis. We place these neurons into four distinct morphological classes distinguished primarily by their dendrite branching complexities. Some class assignments correlate with known proneural gene requirements as well as with central axonal projections. Our data indicate that cells within two morphological classes partition the body wall into distinct, non-overlapping territorial domains and thus are organized as separate tiled sensory systems. The dendritic domains of cells in different classes, by contrast, can overlap extensively. We have examined the cell-autonomous roles of starry night (stan) (also known as flamingo (fmi)) and sequoia (seq) in tiling. Neurons with these genes mutated generally terminate their dendritic fields at normal locations at the lateral margin and segment border, where they meet or approach the like dendrites of adjacent neurons. However, stan mutant neurons occasionally send sparsely branched processes beyond these territories that could potentially mix with adjacent like dendrites. Together, our data suggest that widespread tiling of the larval body wall involves interactions between growing dendritic processes and as yet unidentified signals that allow avoidance by like dendrites.},

@article{Yi2017,
	Abstract = {Responses of different neurons to electric field (EF) are highly variable, which depends on intrinsic properties of cell type. Here we use multi-compartmental biophysical models to investigate how morphologic features affect EF-induced responses in hippocampal CA1 pyramidal neurons. We find that the basic morphologies of neuronal elements, including diameter, length, bend, branch, and axon terminals, are all correlated with somatic depolarization through altering the current sources or sinks created by applied field. Varying them alters the EF threshold for triggering action potentials (APs), and then determines cell sensitivity to suprathreshold field. Introducing excitatory postsynaptic potential increases cell excitability and reduces morphology-dependent EF firing threshold. It is also shown that applying identical subthreshold EF results in distinct polarizations on cell membrane with different realistic morphologies. These findings shed light on the crucial role of morphologies in determining field-induced neural response from the point of view of biophysical models. The predictions are conducive to better understanding the variability in modulatory effects of EF stimulation at the cellular level, which could also aid the interpretations of how applied fields activate central nervous system neurons and affect relevant circuits.},

@article{Schneider-Mizell2016,
	Abstract = {Neuronal circuit mapping using electron microscopy demands laborious proofreading or reconciliation of multiple independent reconstructions. Here, we describe new methods to apply quantitative arbor and network context to iteratively proofread and reconstruct circuits and create anatomically enriched wiring diagrams. We measured the morphological underpinnings of connectivity in new and existing reconstructions of Drosophila sensorimotor (larva) and visual (adult) systems. Synaptic inputs were preferentially located on numerous small, microtubule-free 'twigs' which branch off a single microtubule-containing 'backbone'. Omission of individual twigs accounted for 96{\%} of errors. However, the synapses of highly connected neurons were distributed across multiple twigs. Thus, the robustness of a strong connection to detailed twig anatomy was associated with robustness to reconstruction error. By comparing iterative reconstruction to the consensus of multiple reconstructions, we show that our method overcomes the need for redundant effort through the discovery and application of relationships between cellular neuroanatomy and synaptic connectivity.

	Abstract = {Optogenetics allows the manipulation of neural activity in freely moving animals with millisecond precision, but its application in Drosophila melanogaster has been limited. Here we show that a recently described red activatable channelrhodopsin (ReaChR) permits control of complex behavior in freely moving adult flies, at wavelengths that are not thought to interfere with normal visual function. This tool affords the opportunity to control neural activity over a broad dynamic range of stimulation intensities. Using time-resolved activation, we show that the neural control of male courtship song can be separated into (i) probabilistic, persistent and (ii) deterministic, command-like components. The former, but not the latter, neurons are subject to functional modulation by social experience, which supports the idea that they constitute a locus of state-dependent influence. This separation is not evident using thermogenetic tools, a result underscoring the importance of temporally precise control of neuronal activation in the functional dissection of neural circuits in Drosophila.},

	Abstract = {Normalized cross-correlation has been used extensively for many signal processing applications, but the traditional normalized correlation operation does not meet speed requirements for time-critical applications. In this paper, a new fast algorithm for the computation of the normalized cross-correlation (NCC) without using multiplications is presented. For a search window of size M and a template of size N the fast NCC requires only approximately 2N{\^a}‹{\ldots}(M{\^a}ˆ'N+1) additions/subtractions without multiplications. Simulation results with 100,000 test signals show that the use of the fast NCC instead of the traditional approaches for the determination of the degree of similarity between a test signal and a reference signal (template) brings about a significant improvement in terms of false negative rate, identification rate and computational cost without a significant increase in false positive rate, especially when the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) is higher than 3 dB.},

@article{Costa2010,
	Abstract = {This article proposes the concept of neuromorphological space as the multidimensional space defined by a set of measurements of the morphology of a representative set of almost 6000 biological neurons available from the Neuromorpho database.  For the first time, we analyse such a large database in order to find the general distribution of the geometrical features. We resort to McGhee's biological shape space concept in order to formalise our analysis, allowing for comparison between the geometrically possible tree-like shapes, obtained by using a simple reference model, and real neuronal shapes. Two optimal types of projections, namely, principal component analysis and canonical analysis, are used in order to visualize the originally 20-D neuron distribution into 2-D morphological spaces. These projections allow the most important features to be identified.  A data density analysis is also performed in the original 20-D feature space in order to corroborate the clustering structure.  Several interesting results are reported, including the fact that real neurons occupy only a small region within the geometrically-possible space and that two principal variables are enough to account for about half of the overall data variability. Most of the measurements have been found to be important in representing the morphological variability of the real neurons.},

@article{McGarry2010,
	Abstract = {Deciphering the circuitry of the neocortex requires knowledge of its components, making a systematic classification of neocortical neurons necessary. GABAergic interneurons contribute most of the morphological, electrophysiological and molecular diversity of the cortex, yet interneuron subtypes are still not well defined. To quantitatively identify classes of interneurons, 59 GFP-positive interneurons from a somatostatin-positive mouse line were characterized by whole-cell recordings and anatomical reconstructions. For each neuron, we measured a series of physiological and morphological variables and analyzed these data using unsupervised classification methods. PCA and cluster analysis of morphological variables revealed three groups of cells: one comprised of Martinotti cells, and two other groups of interneurons with a short asymmetric axon targeting layers 2/3 and bending medially.  The PCA and cluster analysis of electrophysiological variables also identified these three groups, particularly with respect to action potential time course. These different morphological and electrophysiological characteristics could make each of these three interneuron subtypes particularly suited for a different function within the cortical circuit.},

This provides confocal 3-D imaging while retaining all the characteristics of the normal 2-D FLIM. The spinning disk arrangement allows us to retain the speed of the normal 2-D full field FLIM while gaining true 3-D resolution. We also introduce the use of wavelet image transformations into the FLIM analysis. Wavelets prove useful for selecting objects according to their morphology, denoising and background subtraction. The performance of the instrument and the analysis routines are tested with quantitative physical samples and examples are presented with complex biological samples.},

Potential interactions between specific proteins in the brain are predicted from assays based on genetic interaction and/or biochemistry. Genetic interaction reveals endogenous, but not necessarily direct, interactions between the proteins. Biochemistry-based assays, on the other hand, demonstrate direct interactions between proteins, but often outside their native environment or without a subcellular context. We aimed to achieve the best of both approaches by visualizing protein interaction directly within the brain of a live animal. Here, we show a proof-of-principle experiment in which the Cdc42 GTPase associates with its alleged partner WASp within neurons during the time and space that coincide with the newly developing CNS.},

@article{Mayerich2012,
	Abstract = {One of the major goals in biomedical image processing is accurate segmentation of networks embedded in volumetric data sets. Biological networks are composed of a meshwork of thin filaments that span large volumes of tissue. Examples of these structures include neurons and microvasculature, which can take the form of both hierarchical trees and fully connected networks, depending on the imaging modality and resolution. Network function depends on both the geometric structure and connectivity. Therefore, there is considerable demand for algorithms that segment biological networks embedded in three-dimensional data. While a large number of tracking and segmentation algorithms have been published, most of these do not generalize well across data sets. One of the major reasons for the lack of general-purpose algorithms is the limited availability of metrics that can be used to quantitatively compare their effectiveness against a pre-constructed ground-truth. In this paper, we propose a robust metric for measuring and visualizing the differences between network models. Our algorithm takes into account both geometry and connectivity to measure network similarity. These metrics are then mapped back onto an explicit model for visualization.},

@article{Sun2014,
	Abstract = {The accuracy of optical flow estimation algorithms has been improving steadily as evidenced by results on the Middlebury optical flow benchmark. The typical formulation, however, has changed little since the work of Horn and Schunck. We attempt to uncover what has made recent advances possible through a thorough analysis of how the objective function, the optimization method, and modern implementation practices influence accuracy. We discover that ``classical'' flow formulations perform surprisingly well when combined with modern optimization and implementation techniques. One key implementation detail is the median filtering of intermediate flow fields during optimization. While this improves the robustness of classical methods it actually leads to higher energy solutions, meaning that these methods are not optimizing the original objective function. To understand the principles behind this phenomenon, we derive a new objective function that formalizes the median filtering heuristic. This objective function includes a non-local smoothness term that robustly integrates flow estimates over large spatial neighborhoods. By modifying this new term to include information about flow and image boundaries we develop a method that can better preserve motion details. To take advantage of the trend towards video in wide-screen format, we further introduce an asymmetric pyramid downsampling scheme that enables the estimation of longer range horizontal motions. The methods are evaluated on the Middlebury, MPI Sintel, and KITTI datasets using the same parameter settings.},

	Abstract = {The human brain is a tissue of vast complexity in terms of the cell types it comprises. Conventional approaches to classifying cell types in the human brain at single cell resolution have been limited to exploring relatively few markers and therefore have provided a limited molecular characterization of any given cell type. We used single cell RNA sequencing on 466 cells to capture the cellular complexity of the adult and fetal human brain at a whole transcriptome level. Healthy adult temporal lobe tissue was obtained during surgical procedures where otherwise normal tissue was removed to gain access to deeper hippocampal pathology in patients with medical refractory seizures. We were able to classify individual cells into all of the major neuronal, glial, and vascular cell types in the brain. We were able to divide neurons into individual communities and show that these communities preserve the categorization of interneuron subtypes that is typically observed with the use of classic interneuron markers. We then used single cell RNA sequencing on fetal human cortical neurons to identify genes that are differentially expressed between fetal and adult neurons and those genes that display an expression gradient that reflects the transition between replicating and quiescent fetal neuronal populations. Finally, we observed the expression of major histocompatibility complex type I genes in a subset of adult neurons, but not fetal neurons. The work presented here demonstrates the applicability of single cell RNA sequencing on the study of the adult human brain and constitutes a first step toward a comprehensive cellular atlas of the human brain.},

	Abstract = {Single cell genomics has made increasingly significant contributions to our understanding of the role that somatic genome variations play in human neuronal diversity and brain diseases. Studying intercellular genome and epigenome variations has provided new clues to the delineation of molecular mechanisms that regulate development, function and plasticity of the human central nervous system (CNS). It has been shown that changes of genomic content and epigenetic profiling at single cell level are involved in the pathogenesis of neuropsychiatric diseases (schizophrenia, mental retardation (intellectual/leaning disability), autism, Alzheimer's disease etc.). Additionally, several brain diseases were found to be associated with genome and chromosome instability (copy number variations, aneuploidy) variably affecting cell populations of the human CNS. The present review focuses on the latest advances of single cell genomics, which have led to a better understanding of molecular mechanisms of neuronal diversity and neuropsychiatric diseases, in the light of dynamically developing fields of systems biology and ``omics''.},

	Abstract = {The Mumford-Shah model is an important variational image segmentation model. A popular multiphase level set approach, the Chan-Vese model, was developed for this model by representing the phases by several overlapping level set functions. Recently, exactly the same model was also formulated by using binary level set functions. In both approaches, the gradient descent equations had to be solved numerically, a procedure which is slow and has the potential of getting stuck in a local minima. In this work, we develop an efficient and global minimization method for the binary level set representation of the multiphase Chan-Vese model based on graph cuts. If the average intensity values of the different phases are sufficiently evenly distributed, the discretized energy function becomes submodular. Otherwise, a novel method for minimizing nonsubmodular functions is proposed with particular emphasis on this energy function.},

	Abstract = {A novel scheme for the detection of object boundaries is presented. The technique is based on active contours evolving in time according to intrinsic geometric measures of the image. The evolving contours naturally split and merge, allowing the simultaneous detection of several objects and both interior and exterior boundaries. The proposed approach is based on the relation between active contours and the computation of geodesics or minimal distance curves. The minimal distance curve lays in a Riemannian space whose metric is defined by the image content. This geodesic approach for object segmentation allows to connect classical ``snakes'' based on energy minimization and geometric active contours based on the theory of curve evolution. Previous models of geometric active contours are improved, allowing stable boundary detection when their gradients suffer from large variations, including gaps. Formal results concerning existence, uniqueness, stability, and correctness of the evolution are presented as well. The scheme was implemented using an efficient algorithm for curve evolution. Experimental results of applying the scheme to real images including objects with holes and medical data imagery demonstrate its power. The results may be extended to 3D object segmentation as well.},

	Abstract = {Motivation: Tracing of neuron morphology is an essential technique in computational neuroscience. However, despite a number of existing methods, few open-source techniques are completely or sufficiently automated and at the same time are able to generate robust results for real 3D microscopy images. Results: We developed all-path-pruning 2.0 (APP2) for 3D neuron tracing. The most important idea is to prune an initial reconstruction tree of a neuron's morphology using a long-segment-first hierarchical procedure instead of the original termini-first-search process in APP. To further enhance the robustness of APP2, we compute the distance transform of all image voxels directly for a gray-scale image, without the need to binarize the image before invoking the conventional distance transform. We also design a fast-marching algorithm-based method to compute the initial reconstruction trees without pre-computing a large graph. This method allows us to trace large images. We bench-tested APP2 on ∼700 3D microscopic images and found that APP2 can generate more satisfactory results in most cases than several previous methods. Availability: The software has been implemented as an open-source Vaa3D plugin. The source code is available in the Vaa3D code repository http://vaa3d.org.

	Abstract = {Motivation: Digital reconstruction, or tracing, of 3D neuron structures is critical toward reverse engineering the wiring and functions of a brain. However, despite a number of existing studies, this task is still challenging, especially when a 3D microscopic image has low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and fragmented neuron segments. Published work can handle these hard situations only by introducing global prior information, such as where a neurite segment starts and terminates. However, manual incorporation of such global information can be very time consuming. Thus, a completely automatic approach for these hard situations is highly desirable.Results: We have developed an automatic graph algorithm, called the all-path pruning (APP), to trace the 3D structure of a neuron. To avoid potential mis-tracing of some parts of a neuron, an APP first produces an initial over-reconstruction, by tracing the optimal geodesic shortest path from the seed location to every possible destination voxel/pixel location in the image. Since the initial reconstruction contains all the possible paths and thus could contain redundant structural components (SC), we simplify the entire reconstruction without compromising its connectedness by pruning the redundant structural elements, using a new maximal-covering minimal-redundant (MCMR) subgraph algorithm. We show that MCMR has a linear computational complexity and will converge. We examined the performance of our method using challenging 3D neuronal image datasets of model organisms (e.g. fruit fly).Availability: The software is available upon request. We plan to eventually release the software as a plugin of the V3D-Neuron package at http://penglab.janelia.org/proj/v3d.Contact: pengh@janelia.hhmi.org},

@article{Gala2014,
	Abstract = {Automating the process of neurite tracing from light microscopy stacks of images is essential for large-scale or high-throughput quantitative studies of neural circuits. While the general layout of labeled neurites can be captured by many automated tracing algorithms, it is often not possible to differentiate reliably between the processes belonging to different cells. The reason is that some neurites in the stack may appear broken due to imperfect labeling, while others may appear fused due to the limited resolution of optical microscopy. Trained neuroanatomists routinely resolve such topological ambiguities during manual tracing tasks by combining information about distances between branches, branch orientations, intensities, calibers, tortuosities, colors, as well as the presence of spines or boutons. Likewise, to evaluate different topological scenarios automatically, we developed a machine learning approach that combines many of the above mentioned features. A specifically designed confidence measure was used to actively train the algorithm during user-assisted tracing procedure. Active learning significantly reduces the training time and makes it possible to obtain less than 1% generalization error rates by providing few training examples. To evaluate the overall performance of the algorithm a number of image stacks were reconstructed automatically, as well as manually by several trained users, making it possible to compare the automated traces to the baseline inter-user variability. Several geometrical and topological features of the traces were selected for the comparisons. These features include the total trace length, the total numbers of branch and terminal points, the affinity of corresponding traces, and the distances between corresponding branch and terminal points. Our results show that when the density of labeled neurites is sufficiently low, automated traces are not significantly different from manual reconstructions obtained by trained users.},

	Abstract = {Learning based approaches have not yet achieved their full potential in optical flow estimation, where their performance still trails heuristic approaches. In this paper, we present an optical flow pipeline that uses patch matching with CNN trained features at multiple scales. We present a novel way for calculating CNN based features for different scales, which performs better than existing methods. Furthermore, we introduce a new thresholded loss for Siamese networks and demonstrate that our loss performs clearly better than existing losses. It also allows to speed up training by a factor of 2 in our tests. Moreover, we discuss new ways of evaluating the robustness of trained features for the application of patch matching for optical flow. An interesting discovery in our paper is that low-pass filtering of feature maps can increase the robustness of features created by CNNs. We proved the competitive performance of our approach by submitting it to the KITTI 2012, KITTI 2015 and MPI-Sintel evaluation portals where we obtained state-of-the-art results on all three datasets.},

	Abstract = {Brain circuit mapping requires digital reconstruction of neuronal morphologies in complicated networks. Despite recent advances in automatic algorithms, reconstruction of neuronal structures is still a bottleneck in circuit mapping due to a lack of appropriate software for both efficient reconstruction and user-friendly editing. Here we present a new software design based on the SWC format, a standardized neuromorphometric format that has been widely used for analyzing neuronal morphologies or sharing neuron reconstructions via online archives such as NeuroMorpho.org. We have also implemented the design in our open-source software called neuTube 1.0. As specified by the design, the software is equipped with parallel 2D and 3D visualization and intuitive neuron tracing/editing functions, allowing the user to efficiently reconstruct neurons from fluorescence image data and edit standard neuron structure files produced by any other reconstruction software. We show the advantages of neuTube 1.0 by comparing it to two other software tools, namely Neuromantic and Neurostudio. The software is available for free at http://www.neutracing.com, which also hosts complete software documentation and video tutorials. Significance Statement: Compared to other existing tools, the novel software we present has some unique features such as comprehensive editing functions and the combination of seed-based tracing and path searching algorithms, as well as their availability in parallel 2D and 3D visualization. These features allow the user to reconstruct neuronal morphology efficiently in a comfortable {\textquoteleft}What You See Is What You Get{\textquoteright} (WYSIWYG) way.},

	Abstract = {We propose an approach to reconstructing tree structures that evolve over time in 2D images and 3D image stacks such as neuronal axons or plant branches. Instead of reconstructing structures in each image independently, we do so for all images simultaneously to take advantage of temporal-consistency constraints. We show that this problem can be formulated as a Quadratic Mixed Integer Program and solved efficiently. The outcome of our approach is a framework that provides substantial improvements in reconstructions over traditional single time-instance formulations. Furthermore, an added benefit of our approach is the ability to automatically detect places where significant changes have occurred over time, which is challenging when considering large amounts of data.},

	Abstract = {We study the 3D neurite tracing problem in different imaging modalities. We consider that the examined images do not provide sufficient contrast between neurite and background, and the signal-to-noise ratio varies spatially. We first split the stack into box sub-volumes, and inside each box we evolve simultaneously a number of different open-curve snakes. The curves deform based on three criteria: local image statistics, local shape smoothness, and a term that enforces pairwise attraction between snakes, given their spatial proximity and shapes. We validate our method using larva Drosophila sensory neurons imaged with confocal laser scanning microscopy, as well as publicly available datasets.},

	Abstract = {We present a conditional random field for three-dimensional neurite tracing, using a population of open curve active contours. We aim at increased robustness under spatially varying neurite-background contrast, and at the same time reducing the computational complexity compared to the state-of-the-art. While most existing active contour based methods perform tracing by evolving multiple snakes along the neurite centerline in a sequential manner, our approach implements a simultaneous evolution, reducing the complexity as we show theoretically in our algorithm analysis and experimentally. Our approach provides increased accuracy in ambiguous regions (e.g., low contrast, neurite bifurcations and crossovers, etc.), by exploiting interactions among spatially neighboring snakes. We illustrate the performance of our method and compare it with existing frameworks using sample volumes of wild-type sensory neurons in the larval Drosophila.},

	Abstract = {A snake is an energy-minimizing spline guided by external constraint forces and influenced by image forces that pull it toward features such as lines and edges. Snakes are active contour models: they lock onto nearby edges, localizing them accurately. Scale-space continuation can be used to enlarge the capture region surrounding a feature. Snakes provide a unified account of a number of visual problems, including detection of edges, lines, and subjective contours; motion tracking; and stereo matching. We have used snakes successfully for interactive interpretation, in which user-imposed constraint forces guide the snake near features of interest.},

	Abstract = {This paper presents an approach for joint segmentation and deformable registration of brain scans of glioma patients to a normal atlas. The proposed method is based on the Expectation Maximization (EM) algorithm that incorporates a glioma growth model for atlas seeding, a process which modifies the normal atlas into one with a tumor and edema. The modified atlas is registered into the patient space and utilized for the posterior probability estimation of various tissue labels. EM iteratively refines the estimates of the registration parameters, the posterior probabilities of tissue labels and the tumor growth model parameters. We have applied this approach to 10 glioma scans acquired with four Magnetic Resonance (MR) modalities (T1, T1-CE, T2 and FLAIR ) and validated the result by comparing them to manual segmentations by clinical experts. The resulting segmentations look promising and quantitatively match well with the expert provided ground truth. {\copyright} 2011 Springer-Verlag.},

	Abstract = {Accurate information about the location of the mandibular canal is essential in case of dental implant surgery. The goal of our research is to find an automatic method which can segment the mandibular canal in Cone-beam CT (CBCT).  
Mandibular canal segmentation methods in literature using a priori shape information are, the 2D active appearance model of Rueda et al., and 3D active shape model (ASM) of Kainmueller et al. The mean distance to manual annotation of the mandibular canal of the method of Kainmueller is around 1.1mm. The best method in literature is Kim et al. with an average distance of 0.7mm.
We develop and evaluate five methods for mandibular canal localization. The methods, Lukas Kanade tracking (LK), B-spline registration, demon registration, 3D active shape model (ASM), and active appearance model (AAM). The ASM and AAM need corresponding points between the mandibles in the training data. We develop and evaluate two methods to find corresponding points, minimum description length (MDL) and the second shape context (SC) based registration. To improve the quality of the CBCT scans we introduce a rotational invariant edge preserving optimized anisotropic diffusion filter.
We evaluate the performance on 13 CBCT scans. The registration methods have an average distance to expert annotation of the canal of more than 4mm, LK tracking a distance of 3mm, AAM and ASM a distance of respectively 2.0mm and 2.3mm.  The MDL method does not improve point correspondences found by the SC method, and the pre-filtering with the introduced diffusion filter does not improve the ASM result. By using location based intensity weights we improve the AAM results, to an average distance of 1.88mm. The relatively large error is due to a low number of training datasets, and low CBCT scan quality.},

@article{Lin2012,
	Abstract = {This paper proposes a numerical algorithm for image registration using energy minimization and nonlinear elasticity regularization. Application to the registration of gene expression data to a neuroanatomical mouse atlas in two dimensions is shown. We apply a nonlinear elasticity regularization to allow larger and smoother deformations, and further enforce optimality constraints on the landmark points distance for better feature matching. To overcome the difficulty of minimizing the nonlinear elasticity functional due to the nonlinearity in the derivatives of the displacement vector field, we introduce a matrix variable to approximate the Jacobian matrix and solve for the simplified Euler-Lagrange equations. By comparison with image registration using linear regularization, experimental results show that the proposed nonlinear elasticity model also needs fewer numerical corrections such as regridding steps for binary image registration, it renders better ground truth, and produces larger mutual information; most importantly, the landmark points distance and L 2 dissimilarity measure between the gene expression data and corresponding mouse atlas are smaller compared with the registration model with biharmonic regularization.},

	Abstract = {This paper presents a new framework for capturing large and complex deformations in image registration and atlas construction. This challenging and recurrent problem in computer vision and medical imaging currently relies on iterative and local approaches, which are prone to local minima and, therefore, limit present methods to relatively small deformations. Our general framework introduces to this effect a new direct feature matching technique that finds global correspondences between images via simple nearest-neighbor searches. More specifically, very large image deformations are captured in Spectral Forces, which are derived from an improved graph spectral representation. We illustrate the benefits of our framework through a new enhanced version of the popular Log-Demons algorithm, named the Spectral Log-Demons, as well as through a groupwise extension, named the Groupwise Spectral Log-Demons, which is relevant for atlas construction. The evaluations of these extended versions demonstrate substantial improvements in accuracy and robustness to large deformations over the conventional Demons approaches.},

@article{Sethian1996,
	Abstract = {A fast marching level set method is presented for monotonically advancing fronts, which leads to an extremely fast scheme for solving the Eikonal equation. Level set methods are numerical techniques for computing the position of propagating fronts. They rely on an initial value partial differential equation for a propagating level set function and use techniques borrowed from hyperbolic conservation laws. Topological changes, corner and cusp development, and accurate determination of geometric properties such as curvature and normal direction are naturally obtained in this setting. This paper describes a particular case of such methods for interfaces whose speed depends only on local position. The technique works by coupling work on entropy conditions for interface motion, the theory of viscosity solutions for Hamilton-Jacobi equations, and fast adaptive narrow band level set methods. The technique is applicable to a variety of problems, including shape-from-shading problems, lithographic development calculations in microchip manufacturing, and arrival time problems in control theory.},

@article{Chang2014a,
	Abstract = {Abstract We exploit the morphological stereotypy and relative simplicity of the Drosophila nervous system to model the diverse neuronal morphologies of individual motor neurons and understand underlying principles of synaptic connectivity in a motor circuit. In our analysis, we use images depicting single neurons labeled with green fluorescent protein (GFP) and serially imaged with laser scanning confocal microscopy. We model morphology with a novel formulation of Conditional Random Fields, a hierarchical latent-state CRF, to capture the highly varying compartment-based structure of the neurons (soma{\^a}€``axon{\^a}€``dendrites). In the training phase, we follow two approaches: (i) hierarchical learning, where compartment labels are given, and (ii) latent-state learning, where compartment labels are not given in the samples. We demonstrate the accuracy of our approach using wild-type motor neurons in the larval ventral nerve cord. However, our method can also be used for the identification of motor neuron mutations, as well as the automated annotation of the motor circuitry in wild type and mutant animals. Our method is directly applicable to the recognition of compartment-defined structures. },

	Abstract = {Snakes, or active contours, have been widely used in image processing applications. Typical roadblocks to consistent performance include limited capture range, noise sensitivity, and poor convergence to concavities. This paper proposes a new design for the snake external force, called vector field convolution (VFC), to address these problems. Qualitative and quantitative comparisons with the gradient vector flow (GVF) external force are presented in this paper to show the advantages of this innovation.},

@article{Li2005,
	Abstract = {In this paper, we present a new variational formulation for geometric active contours that forces the level set function to be close to a signed distance function, and therefore completely eliminates the need of the costly re-initialization procedure. Our variational formulation consists of an internal energy term that penalizes the deviation of the level set function from a signed distance function, and an external energy term that drives the motion of the zero level set toward the desired image features, such as object boundaries. The resulting evolution of the level set function is the gradient flow that minimizes the overall energy functional. The proposed variational level set formulation has three main advantages over the traditional level set formulations. First, a significantly larger time step can be used for numerically solving the evolution partial differential equation, and therefore speeds up the curve evolution. Second, the level set function can be initialized with general functions that are more efficient to construct and easier to use in practice than the widely used signed distance function. Third, the level set evolution in our formulation can be easily implemented by simple finite difference scheme and is computationally more efficient. The proposed algorithm has been applied to both simulated and real images with promising results.},
